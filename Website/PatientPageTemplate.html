<p style="color:red;"><i>This is an example table in html, when database up it will all have to be in JDBC to get SQL values <br>
Also tables and graph should/could be put next to each other, I think that for the layout we should see with Metka<br>
For the graph we need to download an additional tools so it will be done when we have the some data<br>
To collect the data we will probably have to create a SQL file then link it back here somehow (still needs to be worked on)</i></p>
